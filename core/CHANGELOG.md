## 2.7
Features:
* Account deletion: Users can now delete their own accounts. Admins can delete
  any user account. Account deletion removes sessions and their contents created
  by the user and anonymizes data created through participation in other
  sessions.
* Auto-deletion: Accounts can be deleted automatically after a configurable
  period of inactivity.
* OpenID Connect: OIDC is now supported for authentication. Configuration
  discovery support is required.

Improvements:
* Public Session Pool: Added API endpoint to clone a session from the pool.
  Previously, cloning had to be performed by the client.

Bug fixes:
* Import/Export: The handling of session features during import has been fixed.
  The raw exported data can now be imported without further manipulation by the
  client.

## 2.6
Features:
* Experimental support for CouchDB 2 has been added. Note: The data migration
  script is not compatible with CouchDB 2 and has to be run before an upgrade.

Improvements:
* Error handling and logging has been improved. It should now be easier to find
  the cause of problems. API error responses now contain the name of the
  `Exception` which caused the error. Further details for debugging purposes can
  be enabled with the new `api.expose-exception-messages` setting (Do NOT
  enable in production environments!).
* Updated OAuth handling to restore compatibility with 3rd-party login services.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed multiple bugs caused by incorrect type handling in the database layer.
* Fixed XFO header check behind reverse proxy (used by clients when embedding
  external websites).
* Fixed rounding error in learning progress calculation.
* Fixed `security.cors.origins` setting.
* Fixed import of data from older versions.

Security:
* Fixed DoS vulnerability in authentication handling behind reverse proxy.

Configuration changes:  
Minor changes to the web server and Tomcat proxy configuration are required
(see [installation guide](src/site/markdown/installation.md)).

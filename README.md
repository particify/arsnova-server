# ARSnova

ARSnova is a modern, web-based approach to Audience Response Systems (ARS).
It is the basis for the [online service Particify](https://particify.de) and released under an Open Source license.

## ARSnova 2

ARSnova 2 consists of two projects: the mobile frontend and the backend.
This repository contains the backend code.
You will find the frontend at https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/arsnova-webclient-legacy.
However, you do not need to download both repositories in order to get started.

Version 2 is now longer under active development.
It is still maintained meaning it receives security and other important bug fixes but you should not expect any new features.

## ARSnova 3

ARSnova 3 is the version which is under [active development](https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/arsnova-backend).
The software is composed of a web client and multiple backend services.
A good starting point to run ARSnova 3 yourself is the [Docker Orchestration project](https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/docker-orchestration).

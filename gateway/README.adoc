The ARSnova software is composed of multiple components:
the https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/arsnova-webclient[web client] and multiple backend services.
This repository contains the core backend service, a single component of the ARSnova software, and is mainly of interest to developers.
Information about the software in general is available in the https://gitlab.com/particify/dev/foss/arsnova[ARSnova repository].
